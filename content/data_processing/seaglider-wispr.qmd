## Offload data

1.  Glider techs: open Seaglider and remove two micro SD cards from WISPR board

    -   These cards are numbered/ordered to be sure to replace them in the right order (From left to right when looking at the SD slots - Card 1, Card 2, power port)

2.  Plug cards into computer and copy raw .dat files to a hard drive

3.  Pass hard drive off to PAM analyst 

## Decompress data and convert to usable audio file format

1.  PAM analyst: use agate convert WISPR workflow script to convert from .dat to .flac

2.  If you have an existing mission configuration file, skip to step 8. If you do not have one, download the [example configuration file](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/c07366e646cf799da088086068062dce681352c3/agate/settings/agate_config_example.cnf) and complete the following steps to edit it

3.  Open configuration file with text editor and replace “% %%%  TEMPLATE - PUT MISSION METADATA HERE  %%%” with the glider deployment ID

    -   i.e. “% %%% sg639_Sep2024 %%%”

4.  Add the glider serial number to the ‘CONFIG.glider = ‘ argument

    -   i.e. “CONFIG.glider = ‘sgXXX’;”

5.  Add the path to the raw .dat files and path to converted flac files in the following two lines of the configuration file

    -   CONFIG.ws.inDir = 'D:\\sgXXX_Location_Mon20XX_raw_acoustic_data';   % path to raw .dat files

    -   CONFIG.ws.outDir = 'E:\\sgXXX_Location_Mon20XX\\flac';   % path to save converted files

6.  If only converting to flac, comment out all of the other lines in the config file

7.  Save as ‘agate_config_DeploymentID.cnf’ to the input data directory

8.  Download and open [workflow_convertWISPR.m](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/c07366e646cf799da088086068062dce681352c3/agate/example_workflows/workflow_convertWISPR.m) matlab script. Set the path to the agate folder on line 36

9.  Set the path to the configuration file on line 42

10. Run the script, processing should begin. You should see progress updates in the command window and flac files in the output directory you set in the config file

11. If .wav files are needed, use the [flac2wav.m matlab script](https://github.com/sfregosi/myUtils/blob/main/flac2wav.m)

## Create full bandwidth LTSA

1.  Open Triton in MATLAB by typing ‘triton’ into command window. Ensure you are using a version of Triton that supports FLAC files

2.  In the control window, click on Tools -\> Make LTSA from Directory of Files 

3.  Enter 3 for flac

4.  Navigate to your directory of flac files and click ‘Select Folder’

5.  Use 5 seconds and 200 Hz settings, press ok, save LTSA as DeploymentID_SamplingRate_5s_200Hz.ltsa (ex. sg639_Sep2024_200kHz_5s_200Hz.ltsa)

## Update Deployment Tracker Spreadsheet

1.  Open [Glider Deployment Tracker Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MzLF2bmLcWy9u6glj3hu6Q1DINr5-NeJPCuBQgy-LZU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) and ensure all fields have been completed

2.  Use the full bandwidth LTSA to mark the data start and end (or use file timestamps) and assess overall data quality

3.  Use the acoustic effort summary from the post mission processing to fill in the deployment duration, distance, and recording duration columns
