## Offload data

1.  Glider techs: open Slocum glider and remove two micro SD cards from WISPR board
2.  These cards are numbered/ordered to be sure to replace them in the right order (From left to right when looking at the SD slots - Card 1, Card 2, power port)
3.  Plug cards into computer and copy raw .dat files to a hard drive
4.  Pass hard drive off to PAM analyst 

## Decompress data and convert to usable audio file format

1.  PAM analyst: use agate convert WISPR workflow script to convert from .dat to .flac
2.  Download [workflow_convertWISPR.m](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/c07366e646cf799da088086068062dce681352c3/agate/example_workflows/workflow_convertWISPR.m) and the [example Hefring configuration file](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/c07366e646cf799da088086068062dce681352c3/agate/settings/agate_config_hefring.cnf) 
3.  Open configuration file with text editor and replace “% %%%     HEFRING WISPR EXAMPLE            %%%” with the glider deployment ID
    -   i.e. “% %%% stenella-20250414 %%%”
4.  Add the glider serial number to the ‘CONFIG.glider = ‘ argument
    -   i.e. “CONFIG.glider = ‘stenella’;”
5.  Add the path to the raw .dat files and path to converted flac files in the last two lines of the configuration file
6.  Save as ‘agate_config_DeploymentID.cnf’ to the input data directory
7.  If you do not have agate downloaded already, clone the [agate repository](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate) 
8.  Open the convert matlab script and set the path to the agate folder on line 36
9.  Set the path to the configuration file on line 42
10. Run the script, processing should begin. You should see progress updates in the command window and flac files in the output directory you set in the config file
11. If .wav files are needed, use the [flac2wav.m matlab script](https://github.com/sfregosi/myUtils/blob/main/flac2wav.m) 

## Create full bandwidth LTSA

1.  Download a zipped folder of [Triton - flac version](https://github.com/sfregosi/Triton), extract and save it to your Matlab folder as Triton-flac
2.  Open Matlab and set the path to this flac version of Triton
3.  Open Triton by typing ‘triton’ into command window
4.  In the control window, click on Tools -\> Make LTSA from Directory of Files 
5.  Enter 3 for flac
6.  Navigate to your directory of flac files and click ‘Select Folder’
7.  Use 5 seconds and 200 Hz settings, press ok, save LTSA as DeploymentID_SamplingRate_5s_200Hz.ltsa (ex. stenella-20250414_200kHz_5s_200Hz.ltsa)

## Post Mission Processing

METHODS - Work in progress

Work with SWFSC glider team to get post mission metadata (TBD) and create a Mission Report using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_gStQKpFswIsa8mMzGJQ2-xDK0fJE_6092rQl4_PAo/edit?usp=sharing). Save the report to ... (TBD)

## Update Deployment Tracker Spreadsheet

1.  Open [Glider Deployment Tracker Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MzLF2bmLcWy9u6glj3hu6Q1DINr5-NeJPCuBQgy-LZU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) and ensure all fields have been completed
2.  Use the full bandwidth LTSA to mark the data start and end (or use file timestamps) and assess overall data quality 
3.  Calculate the deployment duration, distance, and recording duration and fill in the associated columns
