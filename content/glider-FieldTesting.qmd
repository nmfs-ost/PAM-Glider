title: Field Testing
---

While PAM equipped gliders have been extensively used for specific survey needs, they are also rapidly evolving and require extensive expertise for successful adoption to address additional survey needs. A fundamental requirement to developing a sustainable transition to operations plan for NOAA Fisheries necessarily includes a series of field tests.

Our field testing includes:

1.   [Local Sea Trials](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM-Glider/content/glider-LocalFieldTesting.html) to field test individual gliders to ensure functionality

2.  [Glider Rodeo](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM-Glider/content/glider-rodeo.html) to assess the strengths and limitations of different PAM-Glider platforms and sensors

3.  [Concurrent Ship & Glider Surveys](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM-Glider/content/shipSurveys.html) to collect data for developing advanced statistical methods to assess marine mammal populations using PAM-gliders and to better understand how these methods can augment shipboard surveys.
