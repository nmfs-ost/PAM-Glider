The Cooperative Institute for Marine and Ecosystem Resources Studies
(CIMERS) and Marine Mammal Institute (MMI) at Oregon State University
are world leaders in marine mammal and bioacoustics research.

They were involved in some of the earliest development to use gliders
for marine mammal passive acoustic research and have conducted glider
missions in many ocean basins for the U.S. Navy, BOEM, and NOAA.

### Laurent Beguery

Laurent Beguery obtained his degree in Mechanical Design Engineering in
1998. During the first 15 years of his career, he worked at the French
National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), where he initially
designed underwater seismic measurement stations for the Institut de
Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP). In 2018, he continued his career at
the Technical Division of the National Institute for Earth Sciences and
Astronomy (DT-INSU), where he initiated the use of underwater gliders
for oceanographic studies in France.

In 2014, he joined the company ALSEAMAR, where he continued the design
and testing of the first SEAEXPLORER glider and, together with his team,
led the first sales of gliders. In 2016, wishing to further develop the
use of gliders, he created the service of scientific studies, enabling
companies and research centers to benefit from data acquired at sea.

JASCO specializes in passive acoustic monitoring and autonomous ocean
observing systems. The
[OceanObserver](https://www.jasco.com/oceanobserver), integrated onto a
[Teledyne glider
platform](https://www.jasco.com/oceanobserver-slocum-glider), is
designed to support long-duration monitoring and research applications.

In addition to environmental and scientific use cases, the system also
has potential applications in maritime surveillance, including
persistent monitoring through passive acoustic detection and
localization.
