## Goals

Accelerate the use of uncrewed vessels (UxS) to decrease dependence on
large scale ship surveys. PAM-Gliders provide an opportunity to assess
populations of marine mammals (protected species) and the environment to
augment existing shipboard surveys.

## Objectives

Field testing of PAM-glider platforms to provide data-driven guidance on
the capabilities of each system to (1) work in different operational
environments and (2) address different research questions. This 2-week
sea trial will be conducted off Oahu, Hawai’i in February 2026.

## Approach

We will collect comparable data (at the same time and place) during the
2-week sea trial to assess several glider capabilities. Gliders will
transit tracklines with a 'Figure 8' design, while conducting several
mission modes, with each mode serving as an in-situ experiment for
assessing piloting strategies and impacts on navigation, endurance, and
noise. Modes include:

-   Optimize to survey coverage

-   Optimize for low noise

-   Intermediate approach to survey coverage and noise reduction

-   Drifting (Quiet Mode)

1.  **Piloting:** To achieve mission goals, different gliders may have
    different approaches, advantages, and limitations. These approaches
    may have differing impacts on other critical components (navigation,
    endurance, noise). Also, each glider platform has a unique approach
    to piloting requiring different levels of expertise and abilities to
    modify a mission.

2.  **Navigation:** Different platforms vary in their ability to
    overcome challenges due to currents and navigating hazards. This may
    affect their suitability to work in certain environmental
    conditions, the survey area they can cover, flight efficiency and
    endurance, and the additional noise resulting from maintaining
    course (which reduces quality of acoustic data).

3.  **Endurance:** Primary endurance concerns are related to battery
    endurance (glider platform, environmental sensors, and PAM sensors)
    and PAM data storage. Survey modes provide a means of assessing
    power and storage endurance ranges under a variety of mission
    conditions to inform future survey planning.

4.  **Noise:** Our ability to use PAM gliders to effectively study
    specific species, anthropogenic noise, and/or the marine soundscape
    is necessarily dependent on interference by self-noise produced by
    the glider platform and its components. For each glider, we will
    study the source of each noise identified and the degree to which
    these noise sources interfere with study objectives.

The Glider Rodeo will include glider teams from Pacific Islands
Fisheries Science Center, Southwest Fisheries Science Center as well as
academic partners (Oregon State University, Cornell University) and
industry partners (Alseamar, Teledyne, and Jasco). For more information,

The Glider Rodeo is part of a larger effort to develop a Transition to
Operations plan for PAM-Gliders. For more information on these larger
