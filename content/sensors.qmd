Glider platforms can support one or more options for PAM sensors.
Technology is rapidly developing, and we will be testing the following
PAM Sensors:

[WISPR](https://embeddedocean.com/passive-acoustics-2/){target="_blank"}
(Wideband Intelligent Signal Processor and Recorder) is an acoustic processor 
developed by Embedded Ocean Systems and designed for limited space and low 
power, with options for customized applications. WISPR are currently used on 
Seagliders, and recent integration with Slocum gliders is undergoing testing.

WISPR3 resources can be found [here](https://github.com/embeddedocean/wispr3).

The Digital MONitor
([DMON](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA617025.pdf)) was developed
by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and have been integrated on Slocum
gliders and have been used with
[Seagliders](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/ore/OE/Prof.Howe_PDF/DMON_Van_Uffelen_JOE_2017.pdf).
The current iteration of DMON has limited capacity for high frequency
recording, but expansion of this capacity to improve storage capacity is
under development.

## Auris

The
[Auris](https://www.alseamar-alcen.com/index.php/products/underwater-glider/seaexplorer){target="_blank"}
acoustic processing system is a proprietary system developed for the
Alseamar SeaExplorer glider.
