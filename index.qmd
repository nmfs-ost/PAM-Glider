Passive Acoustic Monitoring is an effective means of monitoring marine
mammals and the marine environment, and NOAA Fisheries is expanding
their efforts into PAM-equipped underwater gliders as a means of
conducting this research to meet their management needs.

This site provides updated information on these efforts.
