Passive Acoustic Monitoring is an effective means of monitoring marine mammals and the marine environment, and NOAA Fisheries is expanding their efforts into PAM-equipped underwater gliders as a means of conducting this research to meet their management needs.

This site provides updated information on these efforts.
