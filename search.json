    "text": "Traditional large-scale surveys of marine mammals are conducted by visual observation from large research vessels. While these surveys collect extremely high-quality data that can be readily analyzed to assess marine mammal populations, they do have their limitations. These methods are complicated for deep-diving species that spend little time at the surface (beaked whales, sperm whales), and they are limited by weather conditions (including fog, rain, and high seas). These surveys are conducted ~ every 5 years during good weather seasons, and so are limited in their ability to assess seasonal and inter-annual variability.\nCan PAM-equipped gliders augment existing shipboard surveys to improve our understanding of deep-diving species or to improve our understanding of temporal variability in marine mammal populations?\nTo address this question, we need to collect data using traditional methods (shipboard visual surveys) and new methods (PAM-gliders) in the same region and at the same time. Data collected during these concurrent surveys are needed to develop and test statistical methods needed to use PAM-glider data to assess marine mammal populations.\nWe will conduct concurrent shipboard/glider surveys off the U.S. West Coast (CalCurCEAS) and Hawaiʻi (WHICEAS).\nData from these surveys will be used for developing Spatial Modeling.",

In addition to visual observations, drifting acoustic recorders were deployed offshore to study beaked whales. This provides an opportunity to compare detection of species offshore Oregon by three different platforms: shipboard visual observation, drifting acoustic recorders, and PAM-equipped gliders. These data will be used to develop the analytical framework for integrating data from slow-moving recording platforms (such as gliders and drifting recorders) into spatial density models for marine mammals (see Spatial Modeling).",

This glider was deployed in conjunction with Teledyne Webb Research from the vessel R/V Benthic Cat. The main objective of this deployment was to test two new sensors: a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor (Biospherical Instruments) and a passive acoustic monitor (“WISPR”, Embedded Ocean Systems). The glider was programmed to fly approximately 70 km north between 9-Mile Bank and Del Mar Steeples toward Oceanside Harbor. However, 36 hours after deployment, the glider mission aborted its mission for a leak in the aft section. An emergency recovery was initiated for February 26 aboard the R/V Outer Limits. Prior to the leak, the glider traveled a total of 29.74 km wile performing 29 dives to a maximum depth of 600 m.\nDetails regarding this sea trial, including pre- and post-trial testing can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Path of “unit_1024.” unit_1024 was deployed 22 km west of Mission Bay, San Diego, CA on February 24, 2025. The glider flew a path west from the initial deployment location and was headed north toward Oceanside, CA, when it aborted its mission for a leak in the aft section. The glider drifted southwest overnight and was recovered on February 26, 2025 by the F/V Outer Limits. Yellow dots indicate where the glider surfaced throughout its deployment, red dots indicate points where the glider aborted its mission, and the bullseye represents the glider’s next waypoint.\n\n\n\nThis was the first deployment of this glider, which was prepared by Teledyne staff. Therefore, no deployment-specific testing was done beyond our standard pre-deployment preparations and tests. Configuration and initialization files for the WISPR prioritized testing of the device and a high sample rate (200 kHz) provided sampling of noise at high frequencies. We were unable to simulate missions with these files prior to deployment because of tight scheduling between glider training and boat availability.\nData were downloaded locally, and a long term spectral average (LTSA) shows high levels of noise at frequencies below 10 kHz and numerous encounters with animals (Figure 2). This field test serves as a first trial of this glider and included sensors that may create their own noise, including a pumped CTD. These recordings will be examined to identify glider noise that may interfere with acoustic detection of the marine environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Long term spectral average (LTSA) of Slocum glider with WISPR acoustic processor during field trials off San Diego, February 2025.",

Slocum Gliders are modular, and two different PAM systems will be tested: the DMON (developed by WHOI) and WISPR (Embedded Ocean Systems).",

Through a partnership with Dave Mellinger at Oregon State University, NOAA researchers at Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center has been testing the passive acoustic capabilities of these gliders to conduct marine mammal monitoring off Hawaiʻi. They will continue this collaboration in 2025 as PIFSC builds out their own glider lab with Seagliders with onboard WISPR acoustic processors. Seaglider support resources can be found here , and WISPR 2.0 specifications can be found here . Note that WISPR 3.0 is under development.",

The SPACIOUS (Spatial Population Assessment of Cetaceans Integrating acoustic Observations from Uncrewed Systems) project aims to develop an analytical framework to integrate data from slow-moving recording platforms (such as gliders and drifters) into spatial density models for cetaceans.\nMore information on this project can be found on the PAM-Stocks site. Our hope is to engage with the broader community of bioacousticians, population ecologists, and glider users that are also thinking about this problem and working toward this goal to create products that will be useful to NOAA and the others. We will plan to share updates and content related to SPACIOUS there."

    "text": "NOAA Fisheries will lead a 3 year effort to accelerate a transition to operations for using PAM-based glider surveys to augment existing surveys. These efforts are based on previous successful research efforts using PAM-equipped gliders off the U.S. East Coast to study right whales, and recent testing of Seagliders off Hawaiʻi. Slocum gliders are being used for real-time monitoring of North Atlantic right whales off the U.S. Atlantic coast through a NEFSC/WHOI collaboration. NOAA’s OMAO UxS Operation Center partnered with PIFSC to test PAM-equipped Seagliders to augment ship-based surveys across the vast Pacific Islands region. The results from these studies highlighted that PAM-equipped gliders can augment and replace some ship-based survey efforts, informing climate assessments, including changes in range or space use, and quantitative metrics, including density.\nTo expand on these efforts, PIFSC and SWFSC will lead a 3 year effort to accelerate the transition to operations for PAM-based glider surveys. The work will be focused in the Pacific initially because these Centers are ready to act and they are collectively responsible for the largest area under NMFS jurisdiction, have acute shortages of adequate shiptime, and must find alternative survey modalities to maintain their assessment operations. Despite the regional focus, the goal will be to develop a Research to Operations plan that can be adapted or applied in other regions seeking to implement PAM-equipped glider surveys to support their marine mammal assessments. The effort includes:\n\nBuild capacity to sustain glider operations. PIFSC and SWFSC will increase capacity to sustain PAM-glider operations through support for glider technicians at each Center and for pilot and technician training. The Pacific-wide R2O plan will include considerations of operational costs for conducting PAM-glider surveys into the future. See Gliders and Sensors to learn more about available (and developing) hardware options.\nIn-water instrumentation testing of several PAM-glider systems with the goal of examining hardware and sensor choices and how these choices may vary based on regional differences in assessment needs and oceanographic realities. For more information, see the Field Testing.\nConcurrent glider and shipboard surveys. We will deploy several PAM-equipped gliders in association with two large-scale assessment surveys- PacMAPPS west coast in 2024 and PacMAPPS Hawaiʻi in 2025. These surveys provide an opportunity to collect glider datasets that can be compared alongside traditional cetacean survey data to guide future survey design and analytical advancements. These surveys happen infrequently, such that this is a time-sensitive opportunity to begin validation of glider-based work. For more information, see the section on Ship & Glider Surveys.\nDevelop Spatial Modeling Methods. We will initiate development of statistical models to accommodate marine mammal acoustic detection data from PAM Gliders, facilitating adoption of these methods to address our stock assessment needs. See PAM-Stocks - Mobile recorders for more information.",
