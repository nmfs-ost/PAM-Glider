    "text": "Approach\nWe will collect comparable data (at the same time and place) during the 2-week sea trial to assess several glider capabilities. Gliders will transit tracklines with a ‘Figure 8’ design, while conducting several mission modes, with each mode serving as an in-situ experiment for assessing piloting strategies and impacts on navigation, endurance, and noise. Modes include:\n\nOptimize to survey coverage\nOptimize for low noise\nIntermediate approach to survey coverage and noise reduction\nDrifting (Quiet Mode)\n\n\nPiloting: To achieve mission goals, different gliders may have different approaches, advantages, and limitations. These approaches may have differing impacts on other critical components (navigation, endurance, noise). Also, each glider platform has a unique approach to piloting requiring different levels of expertise and abilities to modify a mission.\nNavigation: Different platforms vary in their ability to overcome challenges due to currents and navigating hazards. This may affect their suitability to work in certain environmental conditions, the survey area they can cover, flight efficiency and endurance, and the additional noise resulting from maintaining course (which reduces quality of acoustic data).\nEndurance: Primary endurance concerns are related to battery endurance (glider platform, environmental sensors, and PAM sensors) and PAM data storage. Survey modes provide a means of assessing power and storage endurance ranges under a variety of mission conditions to inform future survey planning.\nNoise: Our ability to use PAM gliders to effectively study specific species, anthropogenic noise, and/or the marine soundscape is necessarily dependent on interference by self-noise produced by the glider platform and its components. For each glider, we will study the source of each noise identified and the degree to which these noise sources interfere with study objectives.\n\nThe Glider Rodeo will include glider teams from Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, Southwest Fisheries Science Center as well as academic partners (Oregon State University, Cornell University) and industry partners (Alseamar, Teledyne, and Jasco). For more information, see links to Glider Platformsand PAM Sensors. The Glider Rodeo is part of a larger effort to develop a Transition to Operations plan for PAM-Gliders. For more information on these larger efforts, visit our PAM-Glider site.\n\n\n\nGlider Rodeo draft figure-8 tracklines planned for offshore Hawaii.",

    "text": "NOAA Fisheries will lead a 3 year effort to accelerate a transition to operations for using PAM-based glider surveys to augment existing surveys. These efforts are based on previous successful research efforts using PAM-equipped gliders off the U.S. East Coast to study right whales, and recent testing of Seagliders off Hawaiʻi. Slocum gliders are being used for real-time monitoring of North Atlantic right whales off the U.S. Atlantic coast through a NEFSC/WHOI collaboration. NOAA’s OMAO UxS Operation Center partnered with PIFSC to test PAM-equipped Seagliders to augment ship-based surveys across the vast Pacific Islands region. The results from these studies highlighted that PAM-equipped gliders can augment and replace some ship-based survey efforts, informing climate assessments, including changes in range or space use, and quantitative metrics, including density.\nTo expand on these efforts, PIFSC and SWFSC will lead a 3 year effort to accelerate the transition to operations for PAM-based glider surveys. The work will be focused in the Pacific initially because these Centers are ready to act and they are collectively responsible for the largest area under NMFS jurisdiction, have acute shortages of adequate shiptime, and must find alternative survey modalities to maintain their assessment operations. Despite the regional focus, the goal will be to develop a Research to Operations plan that can be adapted or applied in other regions seeking to implement PAM-equipped glider surveys to support their marine mammal assessments. The effort includes:\n\nBuild capacity to sustain glider operations. PIFSC and SWFSC will increase capacity to sustain PAM-glider operations through support for glider technicians at each Center and for pilot and technician training. The Pacific-wide R2O plan will include considerations of operational costs for conducting PAM-glider surveys into the future. See Gliders and Sensors to learn more about available (and developing) hardware options.\nIn-water instrumentation testing of several PAM-glider systems with the goal of examining hardware and sensor choices and how these choices may vary based on regional differences in assessment needs and oceanographic realities. For more information, see the Field Testing.\nConcurrent glider and shipboard surveys. We will deploy several PAM-equipped gliders in association with two large-scale assessment surveys - PacMAPPS west coast in 2024 and PacMAPPS Hawaiʻi in 2026. These surveys provide an opportunity to collect glider datasets that can be compared alongside traditional cetacean survey data to guide future survey design and analytical advancements. These surveys happen infrequently, such that this is a time-sensitive opportunity to begin validation of glider-based work. For more information, see the section on Ship & Glider Surveys.\nDevelop Spatial Modeling Methods. We will initiate development of statistical models to accommodate marine mammal acoustic detection data from PAM Gliders, facilitating adoption of these methods to address our stock assessment needs.

WISPR are currently used on Seagliders, and recent integration with Slocum gliders is undergoing testing.\nWISPR3 resources can be found here.\nAdditional resources installing and operating the WISPR system on Seagliders can be found at the PIFSC Glider Lab WISPR page.\nThe Digital MONitor (DMON) was developed by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and have been integrated on Slocum gliders and have been used with Seagliders. The current iteration of DMON has limited capacity for high frequency recording, but expansion of this capacity to improve storage capacity is under development.\nThe Auris acoustic processing system is a proprietary system developed for the Alseamar SeaExplorer glider. It can accommodate up to 4 channels with embedded processing capabilities for detection, classification, and beamforming.\nJasco’s OceanObserver can accommodate up to 16 acoustic channels with onboard processing for detection, ambient noise, and ocean environmental measurements.

While these surveys collect extremely high-quality data that can be readily analyzed to assess marine mammal populations, they do have their limitations. These methods are complicated for deep-diving species that spend little time at the surface (beaked whales, sperm whales), and they are limited by weather conditions (including fog, rain, and high seas). These surveys are conducted ~ every 5 years during good weather seasons, and so are limited in their ability to assess seasonal and inter-annual variability.\nCan PAM-equipped gliders augment existing shipboard surveys to improve our understanding of deep-diving species or to improve our understanding of temporal variability in marine mammal populations?\nTo address this question, we need to collect data using traditional methods (shipboard visual surveys) and new methods (PAM-gliders) in the same region and at the same time. Data collected during these concurrent surveys are needed to develop and test statistical methods needed to use PAM-glider data to assess marine mammal populations.\nWe will conduct concurrent shipboard/glider surveys off the U.S. West Coast (CalCurCEAS) and Hawaiʻi (WHICEAS).\nData from these surveys will be used for developing Spatial Modeling.",

This effort builds on historically successful efforts by NMFS to use PAM-equipped gliders including studies of endangered right whales off the U.S. East Coast and odontocetes around the Main Hawaiian Islands. This previous work highlighted the feasibility of using PAM-equipped gliders to bolster data collection efforts for cetacean surveys. Use of gliders is of particular interest in the Pacific region, which is the largest area under NMFS jurisdiction and is subject to acute shortages of adequate ship time; therefore, this region must identify survey modalities that maintain assessment operations over as large an area as possible. While the initial effort is focused in the Pacific region, this project will result in a Research-to-Operations plan that can be adapted or applied in other regions. Primary goals of this work are to (1) build capacity to sustain glider operations within NMFS through purchasing equipment, developing infrastructure, and hiring piloting and technical staff; (2) conduct detailed in-water instrumentation testing and comparison of currently available glider and sensor types to provide guidance for various use cases; (3) conduct concurrent glider and shipboard surveys off both the U.S. West Coast and Main Hawaiian Islands which will provide a unique opportunity to compare these two data streams; and (4) advance animal distribution modeling methods to integrate the PAM-glider collected data into stock assessments.\nLinks: Slides, [Video]\nAlso presented at ASA Honolulu December 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon Rankin, Christian Reiss, Erin Oleson, Selene Fregosi, David K. Mellinger, Erik Norris\nAbstract: NOAA Fisheries has developed a strategic goal of investing in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) from underwater gliders as part of an effort to build a dynamically managed fisheries system that accounts for climate change and supports science- based management and conservation. PAM-equipped gliders provide an autonomous solution to collecting encounter datasets for vocal species that can serve NMFS assessment needs. With dedicated R&D effort, PAM-equipped gliders can augment and replace some ship-based survey efforts, informing climate assessments, including changes in range or space use, and quantitative metrics, including population density. As part of this strategic initiative, NOAA Fisheries will lead a 3-year effort to accelerate the transition to operations for PAM-based glider surveys. The goal will be to develop a research-to-operations plan to implement PAM-equipped glider surveys that support their marine mammal assessments. The effort includes (1) the Glider Rodeo, (2) concurrent glider and shipboard surveys, and (3) the Plankton to Whales project. The Glider Rodeo [see associated presentation], involving in-water testing of several PAM-glider systems, has the goal of examining glider and sensor choices and how these choices may vary based on regional differences in assessment needs and oceanographic realities. The concurrent surveys include deploying several PAM-equipped gliders in association with two large-scale assessment surveys: PacMAPPS West Coast in 2024 and PacMAPPS Hawaii in 2026. These surveys provide an opportunity to collect glider datasets that can be compared alongside traditional cetacean survey data to guide future survey design and analytical advancements. The Plankton to Whales project is a pilot study that will provide seasonal autonomous ecosystem sampling from plankton to whales using paired PAM and oceanographic gliders with shadow- graph sensors for observing plankton.\nLinks: Slides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErik Norris, Shannon Rankin, Erin Oleson, Christian Reiss, Selene Fregosi, David K. Mellinger\nAbstract: As part of a strategic goal to invest in passive acoustic monitoring using the uncrewed systems strategic initiative, NOAA Fisheries is pursuing field tests of several underwater gliders equipped with passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems. These tests will take place during two 2-week ‘glider rodeos’ planned for the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii in 2025-2026. Testing will include Slocum (Teledyne Webb), Seaglider (Univ. Washington), OceanScout (Hefring), and SeaExplorer (Alseamar) platforms with DMON, WISPR, and Alseamar acoustic acquisition systems. A pre-designed survey path will allow resampling of the same area by each glider over each 2-week effort to maximize spatial and temporal overlap. Glider performance and acoustic recording and detection metrics will be measured for each system to enable comparison and inform future glider acquisitions and use by NOAA Fisheries. Metrics under consideration include survey, data quality, and acoustic metrics. This is a unique opportunity to examine the performance and capability of a diverse set of currently available PAMequipped underwater gliders, and we welcome community input into test design and assessment metrics. There may be unfunded opportunities for participation to compare other systems if they are provided, and we will offer logistical support when possible. Results will be made publicly available to inform future research and development.\nLinks: Poster",

Primary goals of this work are to (1) build capacity to sustain glider operations within NMFS through purchasing equipment, developing infrastructure, and hiring piloting and technical staff; (2) conduct detailed in-water instrumentation testing and comparison of currently available glider and sensor types to provide guidance for various use cases; (3) conduct concurrent glider and shipboard surveys off both the U.S. West Coast and Main Hawaiian Islands which will provide a unique opportunity to compare these two data streams; and (4) advance animal distribution modeling methods to integrate the PAM-glider collected data into stock assessments.\nLinks: Slides, [Video]\nAlso presented at ASA Honolulu December 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon Rankin, Christian Reiss, Erin Oleson, Selene Fregosi, David K. Mellinger, Erik Norris\nAbstract: NOAA Fisheries has developed a strategic goal of investing in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) from underwater gliders as part of an effort to build a dynamically managed fisheries system that accounts for climate change and supports science- based management and conservation. PAM-equipped gliders provide an autonomous solution to collecting encounter datasets for vocal species that can serve NMFS assessment needs. With dedicated R&D effort, PAM-equipped gliders can augment and replace some ship-based survey efforts, informing climate assessments, including changes in range or space use, and quantitative metrics, including population density. As part of this strategic initiative, NOAA Fisheries will lead a 3-year effort to accelerate the transition to operations for PAM-based glider surveys. The goal will be to develop a research-to-operations plan to implement PAM-equipped glider surveys that support their marine mammal assessments. The effort includes (1) the Glider Rodeo, (2) concurrent glider and shipboard surveys, and (3) the Plankton to Whales project. The Glider Rodeo [see associated presentation], involving in-water testing of several PAM-glider systems, has the goal of examining glider and sensor choices and how these choices may vary based on regional differences in assessment needs and oceanographic realities. The concurrent surveys include deploying several PAM-equipped gliders in association with two large-scale assessment surveys: PacMAPPS West Coast in 2024 and PacMAPPS Hawaii in 2026. These surveys provide an opportunity to collect glider datasets that can be compared alongside traditional cetacean survey data to guide future survey design and analytical advancements. The Plankton to Whales project is a pilot study that will provide seasonal autonomous ecosystem sampling from plankton to whales using paired PAM and oceanographic gliders with shadow- graph sensors for observing plankton.\nLinks: Slides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErik Norris, Shannon Rankin, Erin Oleson, Christian Reiss, Selene Fregosi, David K. Mellinger\nAbstract: As part of a strategic goal to invest in passive acoustic monitoring using the uncrewed systems strategic initiative, NOAA Fisheries is pursuing field tests of several underwater gliders equipped with passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems. These tests will take place during two 2-week ‘glider rodeos’ planned for the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii in 2025-2026. Testing will include Slocum (Teledyne Webb), Seaglider (Univ. Washington), OceanScout (Hefring), and SeaExplorer (Alseamar) platforms with DMON, WISPR, and Alseamar acoustic acquisition systems. A pre-designed survey path will allow resampling of the same area by each glider over each 2-week effort to maximize spatial and temporal overlap. Glider performance and acoustic recording and detection metrics will be measured for each system to enable comparison and inform future glider acquisitions and use by NOAA Fisheries. Metrics under consideration include survey, data quality, and acoustic metrics. This is a unique opportunity to examine the performance and capability of a diverse set of currently available PAMequipped underwater gliders, and we welcome community input into test design and assessment metrics. There may be unfunded opportunities for participation to compare other systems if they are provided, and we will offer logistical support when possible. Results will be made publicly available to inform future research and development.\nLinks: Poster",
